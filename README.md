# IVF Live Birth Prediction Using PSO and TabTransformer

This repository contains the implementation of our AI-based pipeline for predicting live birth success in IVF treatment cycles. The code includes:

- **Feature selection using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
- **Outcome prediction using TabTransformer*

The pipeline was developed and evaluated as part of our study submitted to *Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine* (CMPB).
